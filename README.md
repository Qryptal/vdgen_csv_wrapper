=================

This script is an example of how the VD Generator can be used to create certificate codes based on information in a CSV file.

You would need a valid VD Generator binary and a license file to try this script.

A sample CSV file (uni_certificates.csv) is provided to try out.

To try:
python csv_vdgen.py  -p "PASSPHRASE" uni_certificates.csv 

For help:
python csv_vdgen.py -h
